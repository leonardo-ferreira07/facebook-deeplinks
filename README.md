Deeplink from your app to Facebook app

### Summary

In this repository you can find some of the deeplinks that can be used to deeplink from your app to Facebook app in order to open some sections inside the Facebook app. This is not an official repository and I found this by my self, researching and trying to deeplink to open Facebook pages or groups straight into the Facebook iOS app.

##### Deeplink to groups

``` fb://group/?id=FACEBOOK_GROUP_ID ```

##### Deeplink to pages

``` fb://page/?id=FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID ```

The `FACEBOOK_GROUP_ID` or `FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID` can be found through [this](https://lookup-id.com) website.

###### That's it for now :+1:
